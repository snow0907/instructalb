AI regulations are coming closer
What makes a generative AI platformtrustworthy?
Can it detect & minimize bias & hallucination?

How does the platform detect and correct bias?
How can it prevent hallucination (providing random and untrue answers with absolute aplomb and conviction)?
Is it transparent?

Open vs. black-box
How to audit and explain a model and the answers it generates?
Does the model track drift and bias? And how does it address them?
Is it safe?


Who has control over the model, input data, and output data?
Can you ensure that confidential informationis not given out?
How is it monitored? 
What safety features and guardrails are in place?
Can it be customized?


Hybrid and multicloud?
Can the model be fine-tuned with your data?
Can it be enhanced and extended to make it more suitable for specific use cases?
How will it integrate with other applications?
How was it trained? 


Garbage in, garbage out
An enterprise should not use a foundation model trained with a Wikipedia crawl
The training material must be huge and comprehensive, but must also be curated
Does it support regulatory compliance?

How do foundation models and their usage comply with privacy and government regulations?
What are the guardrails?
Who is responsible for inadvertently exposed personal identifiable information or a           “wrong answer”?
AI needs governance – the process of directing, monitoring and managing the AI activities of an organization
Governance necessities

AI governance is complicated
Governance is not          a one-size-fits-all approach.
The lack of tools for collaboration and communication impacts stakeholder management


AI governance collaboration requires lots of manual work; amplified by changes in data and model versions.
Companies have models in multiple tools, applications and platforms, developed inside and outside the organization
